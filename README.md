# User-Management-System-with-Zip-Function
This Python script showcases the utilization of the zip function for managing user data efficiently. By combining lists of usernames, passwords, and login dates using zip, users are stored as tuples and dictionaries, facilitating streamlined data manipulation and retrieval.

Initially, the script creates a list of user tuples by zipping the usernames and passwords lists. These tuples represent user credentials, allowing for easy iteration and display.

Next, the script constructs a dictionary of users by zipping usernames and passwords, assigning each username as a key and its corresponding password as the value. This dictionary structure provides a convenient way to access user passwords based on usernames.

Finally, the script combines usernames, passwords, and login_dates using zip to create tuples containing complete user records. This enables the script to manage comprehensive user data, including login dates, in a structured format.

With the use of zip, this script demonstrates an efficient approach to handle user data, offering clarity and simplicity in user management tasks.
